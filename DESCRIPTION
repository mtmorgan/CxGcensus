Description: CELLxGENE census
    <https://chanzuckerberg.github.io/cellxgene-census> is an internet
    resource providing access to hundreds of human and mouse
    single-cell RNA-seq datasets. 'CxGcensus' is an interface to this
    resource, allowing discovery and download of datasets, features
    (genes), and observations (individual cells) from across
    experiments. Datasets, features, and observations are accessible
    as familiar 'tibbles'; measures of single-cell expression are
    presented in the R / Bioconductor 'SingleCellExperiment' data
    representation for easy integration with, for example,
    'Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor'
    <https://bioconductor.org/books/OSCA>.
